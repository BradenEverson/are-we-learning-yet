The Rust machine learning ecosystem is a bit shallow on cluster analysis,
but you can find implementations of k-means, DBSCAN, and OPTICS algorithms
scattered between the crates below.

You can also find an introduction to distribution-based clustering using
Gaussian mixture models in [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine) in this post:
