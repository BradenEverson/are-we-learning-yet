The Rust machine learning ecosystem is a bit shallow on cluster analysis,
but you can find implementations of k-means, DBSCAN, and OPTICS algorithms
scattered between the crates below.

The Rust-ML book has walkthroughs for `linfa`'s DBSCAN and KMeans implementations [here](https://rust-ml.github.io/book/3_kmeans.html).
