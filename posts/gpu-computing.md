GPUs are widely used in machine learning tasks including both training
and inference, making them key components a performant machine learning
ecosystem. Rust's GPU support, particularly around Geneneral-Purpose 
GPU (GPGPU) and compute shaders is incomplete, but a number of efforts
including the [WebGPU](https://wgpu.rs/) ecosystem, as well as 
CUDA and OpenCL are making progress.
