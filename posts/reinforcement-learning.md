Reinforcement learning is the branch of machine learning concerned with sequential decision-making problems. A few interesting libraries exist for applying classical methods (such as Q-learning), including [REnforce](https://github.com/NivenT/REnforce) and [rurel](https://crates.io/crates/rurel). However, implementations of state-of-art learning algorithms are currently limited to [rsrl](https://crates.io/crates/rsrl).
