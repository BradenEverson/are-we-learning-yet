Linear classifiers group items based on the value of the linear combinations of features.

Within the Rust ecosystem, you can find a few libraries ranging from naive Bayes implementations
to support vector machines. These resources can help you get started:

- [Naive Bayes Classifiers in Rust](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/04/08/naive-bayes-rusty-machine.html) - Implementing a naive Bayes model using [rusty-machine](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine)
- [Spam or Ham?](https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge/tree/master/workshops/src/machine_learning) - Building your first classifier using [rustlearn](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-machine)
