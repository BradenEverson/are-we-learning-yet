Several crates have populated the scientific computing space, including
linear algebra and matrix operations, numerical optimization, and more. 

Given the value of iterative analysis in scientific computing,
it's worth checking out [Evcxr REPL](https://github.com/google/evcxr/blob/master/evcxr_repl/).
There is also a [Jupyter backend for Rust](https://github.com/google/evcxr/tree/master/evcxr_jupyter/).

Also, check out some of these resources:

- [A gemmed rabbit hole](http://bluss.github.io/rust/2016/03/28/a-gemmed-rabbit-hole/) - concerning matrix multiplication
- [Linear Algebra in Rust](http://athemathmo.github.io/2016/03/23/linear-algebra-in-rust.html) - intro to the module that became [rulinalg](https://crates.io/crates/rulinalg)
