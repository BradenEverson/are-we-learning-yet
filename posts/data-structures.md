The Rust ecosystem is full of a data structure implementations
that may be useful in machine learning.
You can find multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, graphs,
and a [large list of tree libraries](https://crates.io/search?q=trees).

The list below is incomplete, so for more specific data structures
don't forget to search [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
