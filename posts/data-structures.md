The Rust ecosystem is full of a data structure implementations
that may be useful in machine learning.
You can find multi-dimensional arrays, matrices, graphs,
and a [large list of tree libraries](https://crates.io/search?q=trees).

[num](https://crates.io/crates/num) has emerged as a de facto choice
for numerical types, and a few other crates listed here show
promise, but most ML frameworks have opted to implement
their own data structures, so it's too early to answer
affirmatively to "Are we numpy yet?"

The list below is still lacking,
so for more specific data structures
don't forget to search [crates.io](https://crates.io/).
